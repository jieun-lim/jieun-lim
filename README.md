### 🧐 About me
I have a strong interest in chatbot agent and improving related user experiences based on data science. I have experienced developing a chatbot and a speaker agent based on AI models from an HCI perspective. Also, I've  extracted useful user insights through statistical data analysis.

Recently, I’ve been interested in generative AI models in that it can further improve user experiences in chatbot agents. In this context, I'm  currently participating in the Kakao Tech Bootcamp program to deepen my knowledge in this area.

Other than the academic things, I love swimming 🏊 , running 🏃 and other outdoor activities. My Life motto is to seek out a wide variety of experiences.
